## üìÇ Digital Forensics ‚Äì Static Document Analysis Challenge

### üéØ Purpose of This Analysis
The goal of this challenge was to statically analyze suspicious Microsoft Office documents without executing them, in order to:

- Detect the presence of VBA macros that could execute malicious code.
- Identify auto-execution triggers (e.g., Document_Open) used to launch attacks.
- Extract and review metadata (author, timestamps) that could assist in attribution or timeline building.
- Find Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as URLs, domains, and file hashes.
- Practice using forensic tools (exiftool, olevba, oleid, olemeta) commonly applied in malware triage and incident response.

This process simulates real-world document malware investigations, where opening a malicious file in a live environment could infect the system.  
By using static analysis tools, we can safely gather evidence without executing any harmful code.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Does the file `/root/Desktop/QuestionFiles/PO-465514-180820.doc` contain a VBA macro?

**Method Used:**
```bash
exiftool PO-465514-180820.doc
```

**Observation:**
- The Template field shows `Normal.dotm`, which is macro-enabled.

**Screenshot:**  


**Answer:** ‚úÖ Yes, the file contains a VBA macro.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Macro keyword enabling malicious activity

**Method Used:**
```bash
olevba PO-465514-180820.doc
```
Extracted macro code and looked for auto-execution keywords.

**Observation:**
- Found `Document_Open` in the first line ‚Äî runs automatically when the document is opened.

**Answer:** üîë Macro Keyword: `Document_Open`

**Screenshot Proof:**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Who is the author of the file?

**Method Used:**
```bash
oleid PO-465514-180820.doc
```
Retrieved metadata containing author information.

**Answer:** ‚úçÔ∏è Author: **(Author name from output)**

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Last saved time of the file

**Method Used:**
```bash
olemeta PO-465514-180820.doc
```
Displayed metadata including LastSavedTime.

**Answer:** ‚è≥ Last Saved Time: **(Timestamp from output)**

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Domain from which the malicious XLS file tries to download  
File: `/root/Desktop/QuestionFiles/Siparis_17.xls`

**Method Used:**
```bash
olevba --decode Siparis_17.xls
```
Decoded macros to reveal any embedded URLs.

Verified findings by checking the file hash on VirusTotal.

**Observation:**
- Found IOC: `http://hocosco.mobi`
- VirusTotal confirmed similar domain activity.

**Answer:** üåê Domain: `hocosco.mobi`

**Screenshot Proof:**

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Number of IOCs in the XLS file according to olevba

**Method Used:**
```bash
olevba Siparis_17.xls
```
Checked the IOC extraction table in the output.

**Observation:**
- Detected **2 Indicators of Compromise**.

**Answer:** üìå IOCs Count: **2**

**Screenshot Proof:**
